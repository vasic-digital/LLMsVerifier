### Video 1.3: Your First Model Verification (12:00)

**[Scene: Models page, filtering and selecting a model]**

**Narrator:** "Now for the exciting part - running your first model verification!

Start by navigating to the Models section. Here you'll find all available models organized by provider."

**[Demo: Filtering models by provider and capabilities]**

**Narrator:** "You can filter models by:
- Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Capabilities (code generation, text analysis, reasoning)
- Performance scores
- Cost ranges

Let's select GPT-4 from OpenAI for our first test."

**[Demo: Selecting GPT-4 and clicking "Verify"]**

**Narrator:** "When you click Verify, you'll see the verification configuration screen. For beginners, I recommend starting with the 'Basic' verification type.

This runs a comprehensive but not overwhelming set of tests that evaluate:
- Model responsiveness
- Basic text generation quality
- API reliability
- Cost efficiency"

**[Demo: Selecting Basic verification and starting the test]**

**Narrator:** "Click 'Start Verification' and watch the progress. The system will:
1. Send test prompts to the model
2. Measure response times and quality
3. Calculate performance scores
4. Generate a detailed report

This typically takes 2-3 minutes for a basic verification."

**[Demo: Progress bar advancing, showing real-time metrics]**

**Narrator:** "During verification, you can see:
- Current test being executed
- Progress percentage
- Estimated time remaining
- Any preliminary results

Once complete, you'll receive a comprehensive report."

**[Demo: Verification complete, showing results dashboard]**

**Narrator:** "Congratulations! You've just completed your first LLM verification.

The results show GPT-4's performance across multiple dimensions. In the next video, we'll dive deep into understanding what these scores mean and how to use them for decision-making."

## Module 2: Understanding Verification Results

### Video 2.1: Reading Performance Scores (8:00)

**[Scene: Detailed results page with highlighted metrics]**

**Narrator:** "Now that you know how to run verifications, let's learn how to interpret the results.

Every verification generates scores across multiple dimensions. Understanding these scores is key to making informed model selection decisions."

**[Zoom in on overall score gauge]**

**Narrator:** "The overall score is a weighted average combining all test dimensions. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better performance.

Typically:
- 90-100: Excellent performance
- 80-89: Good performance
- 70-79: Adequate performance
- Below 70: May need improvement"

**[Break down individual metrics]**

**Narrator:** "Let's examine each component score:

**Accuracy (0-100)**: How correct and truthful the model's responses are
**Coherence (0-100)**: How logically consistent and well-structured responses are
**Creativity (0-100)**: Originality and variety in generated content
**Speed (milliseconds)**: Average response time
**Cost ($ per 1K tokens)**: Pricing efficiency

These metrics help you understand the trade-offs between different models."

**[Demo: Hovering over metrics to show detailed explanations]**

**Narrator:** "Clicking on any metric reveals more details, including:
- How the score was calculated
- Comparative benchmarks
- Historical trends
- Improvement suggestions"

### Video 2.2: Comparing Models Side-by-Side (10:00)

**[Scene: Model comparison interface, selecting multiple models]**

**Narrator:** "One of LLM Verifier's most powerful features is the ability to compare models directly.

This helps you understand which model is best for your specific use case."

**[Demo: Selecting 3-4 different models for comparison]**

**Narrator:** "Start by selecting the models you want to compare. You can choose from different providers and model sizes.

The comparison will show:
- Performance differences across all metrics
- Cost analysis for different usage levels
- Strength and weakness analysis
- Recommendation based on your priorities"

**[Demo: Comparison results with radar chart and detailed breakdown]**

**Narrator:** "The radar chart gives you a visual overview of how models compare across dimensions.

For example, you might see that:
- Model A excels at accuracy but is slower
- Model B is faster but more expensive
- Model C offers the best balance of performance and cost"

**[Demo: Adjusting comparison criteria and seeing recommendations change]**

**Narrator:** "You can adjust the importance of different criteria to get personalized recommendations.

For instance:
- If speed is critical, the system will prioritize faster models
- If cost is the main concern, you'll see the most economical options
- For general-purpose use, balanced recommendations work best"

**[Demo: Generating comparison report]**

**Narrator:** "Finally, you can export comparison reports in multiple formats for sharing with stakeholders or including in decision documents."
